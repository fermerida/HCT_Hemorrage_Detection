Head Hemorrage CT analysis
=================

This is a Tensorflow application to analyze CT images and determine if it presents hemorrage. The application is being trained with a clasification model in Tensorflow in charge of analyzing two datasets of images with hemorrage and without and predicting results.

## Data

The data used to train the model is divided in two types
- Presents Hemorrage
- Doesn't present Hemorrage

Therefore the clasified image should be part of one of these groups when the execution ends.

## Dependencies

The following python libraries are necesary to run the software
* Tkinter
* Tensorflow
